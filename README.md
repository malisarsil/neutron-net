![neutron-curve](/neutron-net/resources/real_sim.png) <br />
A lightweight tool to analyse neutron reflectivity curves and generate initial GenX fits.

## About The Project
A neural network based tool for automatic estimation of thin film thicknesses and scattering length densities from neutron reflectivity curves. The project was motivated by the desire to enable on-experiment analysis of reflectivity data, informing choices about changing experiment conditions or samples in operando.

### Built With
* TensorFlow Keras
* Python
* GenX

## Getting Started
### Environment
To replicate development environment with the Anaconda distribution, create an empty conda environment, and run: <br />
```conda install --file requirements_dev.txt -c comet_ml```
### Installation
