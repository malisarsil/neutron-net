A lightweight tool to analyse neutron reflectivity curves and generate initial GenX fits.

## About The Project
Analysis of neutron-reflectivity curves is a process typically of a tedious and monotonous nature. This tool was motivated by the desire to automate the boring part, and simultaenously lower the barrier for entry to use the OFFSPEC instrument at the ISIS Neutron & Muon Source.

### Built With
* TensorFlow Keras
* Python

## Getting Started
### Environment
To replicate development environment with the Anaconda distribution, create an empty conda environment, and run: <br />
```conda install --file requirements_dev.txt -c comet_ml```
### Installation
